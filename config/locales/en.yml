  gradjani_text: Even when you harbour a slightest suspicion of human trafficking, report the case without delay. Become familiar with the problem of human trafficking. It is important for you to understand that in the Balkan countries, where many people live on the breadline, where unemployment rates are high, as well as those of undeclared work and poverty, people often accept the job offers that they did not check. Furthermore, sometimes the offers of human traffickers are hard to distinguish from the regular job offers. Anyone can become a human trafficking victim and no victim is to blame for his/her situation! As a citizen of a society in which liberty is a fundamental right and value, we are obliged to help and make their recovery as easy and successful as possible.

  trgovina_ljudima_text1: Human trafficking involves selling, buying or keeping a person with the purpose of exploitation, as well as all other actions that might constitute a part of that process (i.e. transport, hiding, guarding, etc.). Exploitation is always facilitated and perpetuated by the use of force, threat, deception, abuse of authority and/or abuse of one’s ill-being, by kidnapping, or in some other way. When it comes to trafficking in children, it does not matter which means were used, that is, the case is considered to be the crime act of human trafficking even in cases where there were no elements of threat, force, abuse of power, etc. Furthermore, victim’s consent to exploitation does not change the fact that an act is the one of human trafficking and that it constitutes a crime. 
  trgovina_ljudima_text2: Human trafficking is a global phenomenon which affects all countries, rich or poor, developing or underdeveloped. Serbia, Croatia, FYR Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina are all countries of origin, transit or destination for the victims of human trafficking.

  trendovi_u_trgovini: Human Trafficking Trends in Serbia
  trendovi_u_trgovini_list:
    - The majority of identified victims of human trafficking are Serbian nationals. Out of the total number of the victims identified by ASTRA (by June 2014), 79% have been the citizens of Serbia. Until the end of 2004, the majority of the identified victims were foreign nationals. Ever since then, however, the number of Serbian nationals falling victim to human trafficking has been growing. According to the data of ASTRA and the Center for Protection of Human Trafficking Victims, in 2008 and 2009 only 12-15% of the identified victims were foreign nationals, while in 2013, as much as 96% of the identified victims were Serbian citizens. 
    - Furthermore, there is a high incidence of internal trafficking, meaning that all the phases of human trafficking, from recruitment and transport to exploitation itself, are performed within a single country. Thereby the most frequent destination of exploitation for the victims identified in Serbia is in fact this very country. While in 2009, when this trend was recognised, the share of the victims exploited in Serbia was around 50%, in 2013 it increased to 70%. 
    - Since 2004, a significant rise in the number of children exploited in human trafficking rings has been noted. While in 2002-2003 there were 10% of children among identified victims, last year their share rose to 41%. Regardless of this fact, Serbia still lacks specialised programmes for the recovery of minor victims and measures of treating children who were subjected to trafficking in human beings. The children receive the same type of assistance as the adult victims, they share shelters with them and receive the same treatment, or they are accommodated in the shelters for abused children, where they fail to receive the necessary specialised assistance. 
    - Human trafficking is undoubtedly a gender issue. The majority of the human trafficking victims in Serbia are women and girls (70% according to ASTRA’s data) exposed to sexual exploitation. Furthermore, the victims are sometimes exposed to multiple forms of exploitation (i.e. sexual and labour exploitation, or sexual exploitation and coercion to petty crime). 
    - Nonetheless, another trend recorded by anti-trafficking actors in Serbia is the rise in the number of men among identified victims (26% in the previous 5½ years). In the previous years, mass and irregular migrations of Serbian workers to the Russian Federation and countries of the former USSR were particularly problematic. As a rule, victims of human trafficking as a form of labour exploitation are adult males, usually exploited on international construction sites. Due to the culture bound reasons (patriarchal society does not encourage men to admit that they are victims, or to recognise themselves as such), mode of exploitation (exploitation in construction industry often involves a great number of victims) and unclear identification procedures, the number of identified victims is often significantly smaller than the actual number of people violated in these cases. 
    - Apart from sexual and labour exploitation, other types of human trafficking that are present, though less so, are forced begging, forced marriage, coercion to petty crime and illegal adoption.  
  mk_trends_title: 'Human Trafficking Trends in Macedonia'
  mk_trends:
    - "Macedonia is a country of transit and destination, and for the most part, country of origin of victims of trafficking. In recent years in Macedonia there is a visible phenomenon of internal trafficking against transnational, trafficking in minors, and change in the “modus operandi” of traffickers. In the period from 2000 to 2004, there were only 778 foreign victims of human trafficking versus 26 Macedonian citizens trafficked. According to statistics from the last few years, fewer foreign nationals were trafficked into Macedonia. From the total number of identified victims in 2013, 90% are Macedonian citizens 10% foreigners."
    - "Macedonian citizens are often victims of internal trafficking but some of them are trafficked abroad, mostly in Western European countries. Many of the victims of trafficking come from less developed parts of the country where they are recruited under false pretext for employment in the catering industry and later transferred to the western parts of Macedonia. The majority of trafficked persons are young girls, aged 13-18 years, who are often trafficked for labor and sexual exploitation, then, for forced marriage, forced begging and for committing crimes. In the period from 2009 to 2013 72% of the identified victims were children. Despite this fact, these children lack specialized assistance and support."
    - "Undoubtedly, human trafficking is not gender neutral problem. According to statistics of the Open Gate for the last 5 years 100% of the victims assisted were females. Sometimes, victims at the same time are exposed to a variety of exploitation (sexual and labor exploitation or sexual exploitation and exploitations for committing criminal acts)."
    - "Unfortunately traffickers constantly create new and more inventive ways of recruiting. So lately method that is usually used by traffickers is called “Lover boy” method where mainly lover or potential partner is actual recruiter or mediator in the transfer or sale of the girl from one to another part of the country. Traffickers use less physical violence against victims, freedom of movement of trafficked persons is not so limited and additionally they provide them with certain minimum amount of money which makes the process of detection and identification of victims very difficult. Also trafficking is now in more hidden form, victim exploitation take place in private apartments, houses, villas, or beauty salons, which was not the case in the past when the victims were exploited in nightclubs and restaurants."
    - "Although sexual exploitation is the most common form of human trafficking in Macedonia, the labor exploitation is growing and male victims are identified. Cases of exploitation and trafficking were registered in the construction industry, catering, agriculture and sheepfolds. Additionally, in 2012 was registered a case of 25 Macedonian female citizens exploited in the Netherlands on a mushroom farm. The number of identified victims is often very small compared to the actual figure mainly due to: large number of unreported cases; weak and vague identification procedures; victims are afraid to report the case because they are under threat of traffickers; or lack confidence in the institutions or law enforcement and last but not least victims often do not recognize themselves as victims."
  ba_trends_title: 'Human Trafficking Trends in Bosnia and Herzegovina'
  ba_trends:
    - "Domestic citizens prevail among potential and identified victims of human trafficking. Out of the total number of victims assisted by the International Forum of Solidarity – EMMAUS (MFS-EMMAUS) in their shelter for human trafficking victims, until the end of 2006, the majority were foreign nationals, yet, since then, there have been more and more domestic citizens among potential and identified victims. According to the MFS-EMMAUS data, as well as the data of the Ministry of Security of Bosnia and Herzegovina/ Department for combating trafficking in human beings, in 2008 and 2010 there were only 6-16% of foreign nationals among the identified human trafficking victims, while in 2014 as much as 94% of the identified human trafficking victims were nationals of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
    - "Furthermore, what is also on the rise is internal human trafficking, which assumes that all the phases of trafficking, including recruitment, transport and exploitation itself, take place on the territory of a single country. Thus the most common destination for the victims identified in Bosnia and Herzegovina is actually the very same country. While in 2006, the year that this trend was identified, the share of the victims exploited in Bosnia and Herzegovina was some 60%, since 2010 onwards almost 100% of the human trafficking victims assisted in the MFS-EMMAUS shelter have had Bosnia and Herzegovina as their country of exploitation."
    - "Since 2008, there has been a significant rise in the number of children in human trafficking rings. While in 2002-2003, among the potential and identified human trafficking victims supported in the MFS-EMMAUS shelter, there were 4-10% of children, in 2014 the share of underage persons amounted to 76%. In spite of this, Bosnia and Herzegovina still lacks sufficiently specialised programmes and measures to protect the child victims of human trafficking.<br/><br/>Human trafficking indisputably represents a gender issue. The majority of human trafficking victims in Bosnia and Herzegovina are women and girls (more than 93% according to the MFS-EMMAUS data) exposed to sexual exploitation. Furthermore, the victims are sometimes exposed to multiple exploitations (i.e. sexual and labour exploitation, or sexual exploitation and coercion to crime)."
    - "Nevertheless, the rise was recorded when it comes to the number of men among the potential and identified victims of human trafficking in Bosnia and Herzegovina (20% in 2011, and 29% in 2014). In 2014, especially prominent was the trafficking in men with the purpose of labour exploitation and forced beggary. Among these, there was certain overrepresentation of underage male victims trafficked for the purpose of labour exploitation, usually in forced beggary.<br/><br/>Apart from sexual and labour exploitation, also present, although less so, are other types of exploitation of human trafficking victims – forced marriage and coercion to crime."
  hr_trends_title: "Human Trafficking Trends in Croatia"
  hr_trends:
    - "From 2005 to 2013, the total of 112 human trafficking victims was identified in the Republic of Croatia. Domestic citizens prevailed among the identified victims. Out of the total number of identified victims, 62.5% were the nationals of the Republic of Croatia.<br/><br/>Between 2005 and 2010, 10 underage and 45 adult victims were identified (for one person there were no conclusive data). For the years of 2011, 2012 and 2013, age of the victims was not specified, but they were rather categorised into age groups (i.e. 18-24 year olds), so that no reliable statistical data can be compiled. Due to the lack of the data systematisation, it is not possible to compare the data pertaining to educational levels, belonging to national minorities, age and type of trafficking."
    - "The most frequent types of exploitation are sexual and labour exploitation, with coercion to crime, forced beggary and forced marriage also being represented.<br/><br/>The process of victim identification is not transparent and it still relies on the good will of the state apparatus – political will and public policies which do not have primary victims’ protection in their focus, but rather cater to state’s “higher” interest of protecting security, that is, the control of migration and social policies."
    - "No adequate and independent control of the identification system exists. All the actors who report on the process of victims’ identification, are simultaneously involved in the system of comprehensive support to victims, together with the state, and they are directly dependant on the state funding. Compensation to human trafficking victims still remains a complete theoretical, legal and practical enigma.<br/><br/>The reciprocity of processing criminal acts of human trafficking, in relation to the processing of the acts commonly related to it (i.e. cross-border prostitution), is still not satisfactory. <br/><br/>Conceptually, the state is yet to assume a strategic position pertaining to human trafficking, to facilitate high quality, long-term and analytical interventions dealing with associated trends and phenomena."
  me_trends_title: "Human Trafficking Trends in Montenegro"
  me_trends:
    - "Montenegro is primarily a country of transit for trafficked persons, but also a country of destination. <br/><br/>According to official statistics, from 2004 to 2014,  there were a total of 35 victims of human trafficking in Montenegro, (10 in 2004, six in 2005, three in 2008, three in 2009, one in 2010 and 2011, nine in 2012, one in 2013 and two in 2014). Most of the victims (except five) were foreign citizens originating from Serbia, Ukraine, Kosovo, Albania and Bangladesh. Most victims are women-victims of sexual exploitation and among the victims there were ten men, victims of labor exploitation. As far as child trafficking is concerned, there were six cases from 2004-2014, from 12-17 years old."
    - "The average age of the victims is between the age 17-45. <br/><br/>The above figures on victims of trafficking do not reveal the real scale of the phenomenon as they are limited to those persons who took part in criminal proceedings which resulted in final convictions of perpetrators of trafficking offences. <br/><br/>In addition, a number of other persons were assisted as presumed victims of trafficking, but the data are not available in official statistics. "
    - "According to the State Department Trafficking in Persons Report for 2014, Montenegro is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor. In previous years, victims of sex trafficking identified in Montenegro were primarily women and girls from Montenegro, Serbia, Macedonia, Bosnia, Kosovo, and to a lesser extent, other countries in Eastern Europe. Victims were subjected to sex trafficking within hospitality facilities, bars, restaurants, night clubs, and cafes. Children of ethnic Roma, Ashkali, and Egyptian descent, displaced families, and other vulnerable children from Montenegro, Kosovo, Bosnia, and Serbia were subjected to forced begging on the streets. There have been reports that ethnic Roma girls from Montenegro, who are often forced into domestic servitude, have been sold into servile marriages in Roma communities in Kosovo. Although uncommon, internationally-organized criminal groups subject Montenegrin women and girls to sex trafficking in other Balkan countries."
    - "The Report states that Government of Montenegro does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, but is making significant efforts to do so. The government increased the anti-trafficking budget, elevated the National Coordinator position from under the Ministry of Interior to an independent agency, assigned a new National Coordinator in September 2013, and convicted more trafficking defendants. The government’s law enforcement efforts remained limited; however, it initiated one new investigation and prosecution against a trafficking offender. "
    - "Victim identification remained inadequate. It recommends to Montenegrin authorities to vigorously investigate, prosecute, and convict trafficking offenders, including complicit officials; greatly increase proactive screening of potential victims, especially in vulnerable populations and potential victims of forced labor; develop a multi-disciplinary approach to proactive victim identification and include civil society groups and NGOs in the national referral mechanism; train law enforcement and judiciary officials on a victim-centered approach; continue to train law enforcement and border police on victim identification and trafficking awareness; ensure that police, social workers, and other officials working with high risk populations are trained to proactively identify and refer trafficking victims to services; ensure raids conducted are “smart” raids to free trafficking victims while minimizing harm to others and include arrangements to segregate traffickers from victims, to conduct victim-centered interviews, to cross-reference victims’ accounts, and to quickly transition to post-rescue care and shelter for identified victims; and encourage trafficking victims’ participation in prosecutions against traffickers."
    - "According to EU Progress Report on Montenegro 2013, “a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary and victim oriented approach to trafficking still needs to be developed; identification of victims, as well as investigations, prosecutions and convictions against human beings traffickers need to be improved.” The report stated that organized crime remains a serious concern in Montenegro, underlining that a track record of proactive investigations and final convictions has yet to be established, including confiscation of criminal assets. The report emphasized the need to improve coordination between law enforcement agencies and the judiciary, and to increase capacity to carry out financial investigations in connection with complex criminal investigations.
