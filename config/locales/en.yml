  gradjani_text: Even when you harbour a slightest suspicion of human trafficking, report the case without delay. Become familiar with the problem of human trafficking. It is important for you to understand that in the Balkan countries, where many people live on the breadline, where unemployment rates are high, as well as those of undeclared work and poverty, people often accept the job offers that they did not check. Furthermore, sometimes the offers of human traffickers are hard to distinguish from the regular job offers. Anyone can become a human trafficking victim and no victim is to blame for his/her situation! As a citizen of a society in which liberty is a fundamental right and value, we are obliged to help and make their recovery as easy and successful as possible.

  trgovina_ljudima_text1: Human trafficking involves selling, buying or keeping a person with the purpose of exploitation, as well as all other actions that might constitute a part of that process (i.e. transport, hiding, guarding, etc.). Exploitation is always facilitated and perpetuated by the use of force, threat, deception, abuse of authority and/or abuse of one’s ill-being, by kidnapping, or in some other way. When it comes to trafficking in children, it does not matter which means were used, that is, the case is considered to be the crime act of human trafficking even in cases where there were no elements of threat, force, abuse of power, etc. Furthermore, victim’s consent to exploitation does not change the fact that an act is the one of human trafficking and that it constitutes a crime. 
  trgovina_ljudima_text2: Human trafficking is a global phenomenon which affects all countries, rich or poor, developing or underdeveloped. Serbia, Croatia, FYR Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina are all countries of origin, transit or destination for the victims of human trafficking.

  trendovi_u_trgovini: Human Trafficking Trends in Serbia
  trendovi_u_trgovini_list:
    - The majority of identified victims of human trafficking are Serbian nationals. Out of the total number of the victims identified by ASTRA (by June 2014), 79% have been the citizens of Serbia. Until the end of 2004, the majority of the identified victims were foreign nationals. Ever since then, however, the number of Serbian nationals falling victim to human trafficking has been growing. According to the data of ASTRA and the Center for Protection of Human Trafficking Victims, in 2008 and 2009 only 12-15% of the identified victims were foreign nationals, while in 2013, as much as 96% of the identified victims were Serbian citizens. 
    - Furthermore, there is a high incidence of internal trafficking, meaning that all the phases of human trafficking, from recruitment and transport to exploitation itself, are performed within a single country. Thereby the most frequent destination of exploitation for the victims identified in Serbia is in fact this very country. While in 2009, when this trend was recognised, the share of the victims exploited in Serbia was around 50%, in 2013 it increased to 70%. 
    - Since 2004, a significant rise in the number of children exploited in human trafficking rings has been noted. While in 2002-2003 there were 10% of children among identified victims, last year their share rose to 41%. Regardless of this fact, Serbia still lacks specialised programmes for the recovery of minor victims and measures of treating children who were subjected to trafficking in human beings. The children receive the same type of assistance as the adult victims, they share shelters with them and receive the same treatment, or they are accommodated in the shelters for abused children, where they fail to receive the necessary specialised assistance. 
    - Human trafficking is undoubtedly a gender issue. The majority of the human trafficking victims in Serbia are women and girls (70% according to ASTRA’s data) exposed to sexual exploitation. Furthermore, the victims are sometimes exposed to multiple forms of exploitation (i.e. sexual and labour exploitation, or sexual exploitation and coercion to petty crime). 
    - Nonetheless, another trend recorded by anti-trafficking actors in Serbia is the rise in the number of men among identified victims (26% in the previous 5½ years). In the previous years, mass and irregular migrations of Serbian workers to the Russian Federation and countries of the former USSR were particularly problematic. As a rule, victims of human trafficking as a form of labour exploitation are adult males, usually exploited on international construction sites. Due to the culture bound reasons (patriarchal society does not encourage men to admit that they are victims, or to recognise themselves as such), mode of exploitation (exploitation in construction industry often involves a great number of victims) and unclear identification procedures, the number of identified victims is often significantly smaller than the actual number of people violated in these cases. 
    - Apart from sexual and labour exploitation, other types of human trafficking that are present, though less so, are forced begging, forced marriage, coercion to petty crime and illegal adoption.
